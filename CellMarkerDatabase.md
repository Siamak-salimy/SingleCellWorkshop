There are several cell type databases available for researchers to access and explore various types of cells and their characteristics. Some well-known cell type databases include:

1. CellMarkerDatabase: As mentioned earlier, this database provides information about cell markers and their expression patterns in different cell types, tissues, and organs.

2. Human Cell Atlas: This is an international collaborative project that aims to create a comprehensive reference map of all human cells, capturing gene expression profiles, epigenetic landscapes, and cellular phenotypes.

3. Allen Cell Types Database: This database offers a systematic and comprehensive characterization of the diversity of cell types in the mouse primary visual cortex.</br>

4. Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen): ImmGen provides gene expression data for various immune cells to help researchers better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying immune system function.

5. Single Cell Portal (Broad Institute): This resource provides access to single-cell genomics data sets, including information on diverse cell types from different tissues and organisms.

These databases can be valuable tools for researchers studying specific cell types or working on projects related to developmental biology, immunology, neuroscience, oncology, or other fields where understanding the characteristics of different cell types is important.
