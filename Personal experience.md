This section delves into the nuanced tapestry of my personal encounters and professional journey while navigating the intricate realm of single-cell research.</Br>
Throughout my tenure, I've had the privilege of immersing myself in the intricate world of single-cell analysis, where every cell tells a unique story waiting to be deciphered. These shared experiences encapsulate the challenges, triumphs, and transformative moments encountered while probing the enigmatic intricacies of singular cellular entities. </Br>
As I recount this odyssey, the narrative unfolds, unveiling the profound insights gained, the innovations witnessed, and the evolution of methodologies that have propelled the frontiers of single-cell exploration. Join me on this enlightening voyage through the microcosm of single cells, where each experience has woven an indelible tapestry of learning and discovery.</Br>
1 : SRR VS Count matrix :</Br>
  In lieu of employing raw data, my approach centered on harnessing processed data sets and their corresponding count matrices. This strategic pivot allowed for a more refined analysis, enabling a comprehensive exploration of intricate biological pathways and cellular dynamics. ( Use Count matrix instead of Raw files ðŸ˜Ž ) </Br>
2 : Try 10X . </Br>
  What is 10X ? 10x Genomics is a microfluidics-based method of single-cell RNA sequencing. The technique makes use of the Chromium system, a device that enables single-cell sequencing with their Next GEM technology.</Br>
Read publications , Reanalyze their results and increase your XP . </Br>Whare ? How a goog question ðŸ˜Ž From Here : https://www.10xgenomics.com/</Br>
3 : Read related articles. By reading the articles, you can find the data you need better.</Br>
4 : Use Ubunto instead of VMWare or windows.</Br>
5 : Use HGR38</Br>
6 : Use Bulild-in Index file from STAR . </Br>
7 : You can use Bash scripts to run commands ,but it is recommended to run them seperately . </Br>
8 : Towards the conclusion of the Linux section, when you reach the count matrix stage, consider leveraging this data or seeking out an existing pre-analyzed count matrix for further exploration and analysis.</Br>
9 : Read Article , Read Article , Read Article , Read Article , !!!! by this you will have an comprehensive  view to available Dataset .</Br>
10:Seurat is the main package in R section ! Try 4.3.0 Version </Br>
11:Try To Understand the codes ! </Br>
12:Strive to adhere to the established pipeline rather than opting for manual separation. Relying on autocodes or autopackages may not prove beneficial in achieving your objectives.</Br>
13:Use PCA and Umap !
