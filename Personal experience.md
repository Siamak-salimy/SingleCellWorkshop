This section delves into the nuanced tapestry of my personal encounters and professional journey while navigating the intricate realm of single-cell research.
Throughout my tenure, I've had the privilege of immersing myself in the intricate world of single-cell analysis, where every cell tells a unique story waiting to be deciphered. These shared experiences encapsulate the challenges, triumphs, and transformative moments encountered while probing the enigmatic intricacies of singular cellular entities. 
As I recount this odyssey, the narrative unfolds, unveiling the profound insights gained, the innovations witnessed, and the evolution of methodologies that have propelled the frontiers of single-cell exploration. Join me on this enlightening voyage through the microcosm of single cells, where each experience has woven an indelible tapestry of learning and discovery.</Br>
1 : SRR VS Count matrix :</Br>
  In lieu of employing raw data, my approach centered on harnessing processed data sets and their corresponding count matrices. This strategic pivot allowed for a more refined analysis, enabling a comprehensive exploration of intricate biological pathways and cellular dynamics. ( Use Count matrix instead of Raw files ðŸ˜Ž ) </Br>
2 : Try 10X . </Br>
  What is 10X ? 10x Genomics is a microfluidics-based method of single-cell RNA sequencing. The technique makes use of the Chromium system, a device that enables single-cell sequencing with their Next GEM technology.</Br>
Read publications , Reanalyze their results and increase your XP . </Br>Whare ? How a goog question ðŸ˜Ž From Here : https://www.10xgenomics.com/</Br>
3 : Read related articles. By reading the articles, you can find the data you need better.</Br>
4 : Use Ubunto instead of VMWare or windows.</Br>
5 : Use HGR38</Br>
6 : Use Bulild-in Index file from STAR . </Br>
7: You can use Bash scripts to run commands ,but it is recommended to run them seperately . </Br>
8:At the end of Linux part , you have a count matrix , use it or try to find a pre-analysed count matrix  </Br>
