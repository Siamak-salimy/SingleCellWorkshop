This section delves into the nuanced tapestry of my personal encounters and professional journey while navigating the intricate realm of single-cell research.
Throughout my tenure, I've had the privilege of immersing myself in the intricate world of single-cell analysis, where every cell tells a unique story waiting to be deciphered. These shared experiences encapsulate the challenges, triumphs, and transformative moments encountered while probing the enigmatic intricacies of singular cellular entities. 
As I recount this odyssey, the narrative unfolds, unveiling the profound insights gained, the innovations witnessed, and the evolution of methodologies that have propelled the frontiers of single-cell exploration. Join me on this enlightening voyage through the microcosm of single cells, where each experience has woven an indelible tapestry of learning and discovery.
1 : SRR VS Count matrix :</Br>
  In lieu of employing raw data, my approach centered on harnessing processed data sets and their corresponding count matrices. This strategic pivot allowed for a more refined analysis, enabling a comprehensive exploration of intricate biological pathways and cellular dynamics. ( Use Count matrix instead of Raw files ðŸ˜Ž ) </Br>
2 : Try 10X . </Br>
  What is 10X ? 10x Genomics is a microfluidics-based method of single-cell RNA sequencing. The technique makes use of the Chromium system, a device that enables single-cell sequencing with their Next GEM technology.</Br>
